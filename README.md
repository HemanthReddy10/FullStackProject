# FullStackProject

Created a Full stack web application using Spring Boot and React. In this project, I have used  Spring Boot ( MVC, JPA, Hibernate) and Mysql Database to create the Backend application (Restful web service API) with and used  React.js to create the frontend application with Material UI and React Hooks( useState, useEffect) with functional components. Developed  full stack project with RESTful Web services API and also used fetch (you can use axios) for consuming REST API.
